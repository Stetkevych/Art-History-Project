          <figcaption class="card-caption">"Impression, Sunrise," by Claude Monet <br><br>
            1872, oil on canvas, impressionism movement <br><br>
            The painting depicts Monet's hometown, Le Havre, at sunrise. It is renowned for its loose brushwork and vibrant color palette, capturing the fleeting effects of light and atmosphere.
            The "hazy" painting style inspired Monet's titling of the work, "Impression, Sunrise", which coined the term "Impressionism" for the art movement that followed.
            France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian war in 1871, and the port at Le Havre was a symbol of national pride and recovery. The combination of steamboats and cranes may symbolize the revitalization of French industry and commerce after the war.

          <figcaption class="card-caption">"Au Lapin Agile", by Pablo Picasso 
            <br><br>
            1905, oil on canvas, rose period <br><br>
            The painting portrays a lively scene inside the famous Montmartre cabaret, Au Lapin Agile, capturing the bohemian spirit of early 20th-century Paris.
            The use of warm colors and playful composition reflects Picasso's Rose Period, characterized by a lighter palette and themes of circus performers and entertainers.
            The cabaret was a hub for artists, writers, and musicians, symbolizing the vibrant cultural life of Montmartre during this era.

          <figcaption class="card-caption">Houses at L'Estaque, by Georges Braque
            <br><br>
            1908, oil on canvas, cubism movement <br><br>
            The painting depicts a view of the village of L'Estaque near Marseille, characterized by its geometric forms and fragmented perspective, typical of the Cubist style.
            Braque's use of muted colors and simplified shapes reflects his exploration of form and structure, moving away from traditional representation towards abstraction.
            The work captures the essence of the landscape while challenging conventional notions of perspective and depth, marking a significant development in modern art.

            <br><br>
            1889, oil on canvas, post-impressionism movement <br><br>
            The painting portrays a swirling night sky over a quiet town, capturing Van Gogh's emotional and expressive style.
            The vibrant colors and dynamic brushstrokes convey a sense of movement and intensity, reflecting Van Gogh's inner turmoil and fascination with the night sky.

          <figcaption class="card-caption">Campbell's Soup Cans, by Andy Warhol
            <br><br>
            1962, synthetic polymer paint on canvas, pop art movement <br><br>
            The artwork features 32 canvases, each depicting a different variety of Campbell's Soup, arranged in a grid-like format.
            Warhol's use of commercial imagery challenges traditional notions of art and consumer culture, reflecting the rise of mass production and advertising in post-war America.
            The repetition of the soup cans emphasizes the ubiquity of consumer goods and questions the distinction between high art and popular culture.

            <figcaption class="card-caption">Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci
            <br><br>
            1503-1506, oil on poplar panel, renaissance movement 
            <br><br>
            Interestingly, Leonardo da Vinci did not draw outlines, nor did he sign his paintings. Some attribute the ultra-realistic quality of the Mona Lisa to not having outlines, as it allows for softer transitions between colors and tones. This technique, known as sfumato, creates a more lifelike and three-dimensional appearance.
